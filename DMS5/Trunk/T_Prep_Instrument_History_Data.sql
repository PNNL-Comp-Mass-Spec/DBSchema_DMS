Purge valve assembly (G1311-60009)
Inlet filters for reservoirs B & D (5041-2168)
Both wash seals on pump head (0905-1175)
Both Film Washers on pump head (01018-07102)
AIV cartridge in mixer (5062-8562)
Metering seal on 900 uL injector head (0905-1294)
Needle (G1313-87201)
Needle seat (G1313-87101)

Performed the following maintenance:

Purge valve on pump head was leaking, replaced it.
Replaced piece of tubing that runs through the peristaltic pump for the wash seals.
Changed out all seals on pump head EXCEPT piston seals (did not have the parts to do this), as well as AIV cartridge in the mixer.
Changed water for seal wash
Cleaned drain for Autosampler (crusted with salts)
Cleaned 900 uL injector head completely - it was dripping rusty salts, the metering seal was changed, but the seal holder (not the head) probably needs changed as well.
Replaced inlet solvent filters due on lines B & D due to chipping and cracking.
Replaced needle & seat

1.	The methods have been adjusted for this change, but if you come across something that is not working properly, please let me know 
2.	Those methods that do not have a name saved with them (i.e.  Method A - Erika) have been adjusted so that they are utilizing the liquid level following to reduce sample carry-over.  The rinse of the probes for after the sample has been added to the column has also been increased on all of these methods. 
3.	Two new methods have been created.  They are "Buffer Prime - C18" and "Buffer Prime - SCX".  These not only prime the syringes for the water line (similar to the pump rinse method) but also prime the transfer ports to ensure the liquid is at the appropriate level.','7/27/2010 3:11:06 PM','D3P704')
