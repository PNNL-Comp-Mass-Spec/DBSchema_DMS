Explanation of priority levels:
  1 - Critical risk of data loss.  Fix this ASAP.
 10 - Security risk.
 20 - Security risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
 50 - Reliability risk.
 60 - Reliability risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
100 - Performance risk.
110 - Performance risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
200 - Informational.
250 - Server info. Not warnings, just explaining data about the server.

Known limitations of this version:
 - No support for SQL Server 2000 or compatibility mode 80.
 - If a database name has a question mark in it, some tests will fail.  Gotta
   love that unsupported sp_MSforeachdb.

Unknown limitations of this version:
 - None.  (If we knew them, they'd be known.  Duh.)
 
Changes in v18:
 - Alin Selicean @AlinSelicean:
   - Added check 93 looking for backups stored on the same drive letter as user
	 database files. Will give false positives if both your user databases
	 and backup files are mount points on the same drive letter, but hey,
	 don't do that.
   - Fixed typo in check 88 that wouldn't run if check 91 was being skipped.
   - Improved check 72, non-aligned partitioned indexes, to include the 
	 database name even if the index hadn't been used since restart.
 - David Forck @Thirster42:
   - Added check 94 for Agent jobs that are not set up to notify an operator
	 upon failure.
   - Improved check 80 to ignore max file sizes for filestream data files.
 - Dino Maric added check 92 for free drive space. (Not an alert, just runs if
   you set @CheckServerInfo = 1.) Doesn't include mount points.
 - Eric Alter fixed bug with missing begin/end in check 83.
 - Nigel Maneffa fixed a broken link in check 91 for merge replication.
 - Added check 86 back in for elevated database permissions.
 - Replaced @@SERVERNAME usage with SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName') because in
   some cloud hosting environments, these don't match, and it's okay.
 - Changed database name variables to be NVARCHAR(128). Dang SharePoint.
	
Changes in v17: 
 - Alin Selician:
   - Fixed bug in check 72 for partitioned indexes that weren't aligned.
   - Suggested check 88 for SQL Server's last restart.
 - Nigel Maneffa:
   - Added check 90 for corruption alerts in msdb.dbo.suspect_pages.
   - Added check 91 for merge replication with infinite retention.
 - Nancy Hidy Wilson @NancyHidyWilson fixed a bug in the sys.configurations
   check 22: SQL 2012 changed the remote login timeout setting from 20 to 10.
 - Roland Rosso suggested to add parameters for @IgnorePrioritiesBelow and
   @IgnorePrioritiesAbove so you can just return results for some types of checks.
 - Russell Hart fixed a bug in the DBCC CHECKDB check that failed on systems
   using British date formats.
 - Stephanie Richter fixed description typo in check 57 for Agent startup jobs.
 - Steve Wales caught dupe checkID's 60, changed one to 87.
 - Improved check 78 for implicit conversion so that it checks sys.sql_modules
   for the is_recompiled bit flag rather than scanning the source code. 
 - Added check 89 looking for corruption reports in dm_hadr_auto_page_repair.
 - Improved checks 58 and 76 (collation mismatches) to exclude ReportServer and
   ReportServerTempDB. Microsoft builds those databases their own special way.
 - Improved check 22, the default sys.configurations check, to add new SQL 2012
   settings, deal with odd default min server memory settings (we're seeing
   both 0mb and 16mb in the wild as defaults).
 - Added @OutputType = 'CSV' option that strips commas and returns one field per
   row rather than separate fields of data. Doesn't return the query and query
   plan fields since those are monsters.
 - Created support for excluding databases and/or checks.  This will handled via a table that holds
   the servers, databases and checks that you would like skipped. Use the script below (naming the table)to 
   create the table
     CREATE TABLE dbo.Whatever
      (ID INT IDENTITY(1,1),
      ServerName NVARCHAR(128),
      DatabaseName NVARCHAR(128), 
      CheckID INT)
      
  ServerName = 'MyServer, DatabaseName = NULL, CheckId = NULL - will not check anything on servername MyServer
  ServerName = NULL, DatabaseName = 'MyDB', CheckId = NULL - will not check MyDB on any server
  ServerName = 'MyServer', DatabaseName = 'MyDB', CheckId = NULL - will not check MyDB on MyServer
  ServerName = NULL, DatabaseName = NULL, CheckId = 5 - will skip CheckId 5 on all databases
  ServerName = NULL, DatabaseName = 'MyDB', CheckId = 5 - will skip CheckId 5 on MyDB
  
  The new variables @SkipChecksServer, @SkipChecksDatabase, @SkipChecksSchema and @SkipChecksTable provide
  the path to where the new table lives. 


Changes in v16:
 - Vladimir Vissoultchev rewrote the DBCC CHECKDB check to work around a bug in
   SQL Server 2008 & R2 that report dbi_dbccLastKnownGood twice. For more info
   on the bug, check Connect ID 485869.
 - Chris Fradenburg @ChrisFradenburg http://www.fradensql.com:
   - Check 81 for non-active sp_configure options not yet taking effect.
   - Improved check 35 to not alert if Optimize for Ad Hoc is already enabled.
 - Rob Sullivan @DataChomp http://datachomp.com:
   - Suggested to add output variable @Version to manage server installations.
 - Vadim Mordkovich:
   - Added check 86 for database users with elevated database roles like
     db_owner, db_securityadmin, etc.
 - Vladimir Vissoultchev rewrote the DBCC CHECKDB check to work around a bug in
   SQL Server 2008 & R2 that report dbi_dbccLastKnownGood twice. For more info
   on the bug, check Connect ID 485869.
 - Added check 77 for database snapshots.
 - Added check 78 for stored procedures with WITH RECOMPILE in the source code.
 - Added check 79 for Agent jobs with SHRINKDATABASE or SHRINKFILE.
 - Added check 80 for databases with a max file size set.
 - Added @CheckServerInfo perameter default 0. Adds additional server inventory
   data in checks 83-85 for things like CPU, memory, service logins.  None of
   these are problems, but if you're using sp_Blitz to assess a server you've
   never seen, you may want to know more about what you're working with. I do.
 - Added checks 83-85 for server descriptions (CPU, memory, services.)
 - Tweaked check 75 for large log files so that it only alerts on files > 1GB.
 - Changed one of the two check 59's to be check 82. (Doh!)
 - Added WITH NO_INFOMSGS to the DBCC calls to ease life for automation folks.
 - Works with offline and restoring databases. (Just happened to test it in
   this version and it already worked - must have fixed this earlier.)

Changes in v15:
 - Mikael Wedham caught bugs in a few checks that reported the wrong database name.
 - Bob Klimes fixed bugs in several checks where v14 broke case sensitivity.
 - Seth Washeck fixed bugs in the VLF checks so they include the number of VLFs.

Changes in v14:
 - Lori Edwards @LoriEdwards http://sqlservertimes2.com
     - Did all the coding in this version! She did a killer job of integrating
       improvements and suggestions from all kinds of people, including:
 - Chris Fradenburg @ChrisFradenburg http://www.fradensql.com 
     - Check 74 to identify globally enabled traceflags
 - Jeremy Lowell @DataRealized http://datarealized.com added:
     - Check 72 for non-aligned indexes on partitioned tables
 - Paul Anderton @Panders69 added check 69 to check for high VLF count
 - Ron van Moorsel added several changes
   - Added a change to check 6 to use sys.server_principals instead of syslogins
   - Added a change to check 25 to check whether tempdb was set to autogrow.  
   - Added a change to check 49 to check for linked servers configured with the SA login
 - Shaun Stuart @shaunjstu http://shaunjstuart.com added several changes:
   - Added check 68 to check for the last successful DBCC CHECKDB
   - Updated check 1 to verify the backup came from the current 
   - Added check 70 to verify that @@servername is not null
 - Typo in check 51 changing free to present thanks to Sabu Varghese
 - Check 73 to determine if a failsafe operator has been configured
 - Check 75 for transaction log files larger than data files suggested by Chris Adkin
 - Fixed a bunch of bugs for oddball database names (like apostrophes).

Changes in v13:
 - Fixed typos in descriptions of checks 60 & 61 thanks to Mark Hions.
 - Improved check 14 to work with collations thanks to Greg Ackerland.
 - Improved several of the backup checks to exclude database snapshots and
   databases that are currently being restored thanks to Greg Ackerland.
 - Improved wording on check 51 thanks to Stephen Criddle.
 - Added top line introducing the reader to sp_Blitz and the version number.
 - Changed Brent Ozar PLF, LLC to Brent Ozar Unlimited. Great catch by
   Hondo Henriques, @SQLHondo.
 - If you've submitted code recently to sp_Blitz, hang in there! We're still
   building a big new version with lots of new checks. Just fixing bugs in
   this small release.

Changes in v12:
 - Added plan cache (aka procedure cache) analysis. Examines top resource-using
   queries for common problems like implicit conversions, missing indexes, etc.
 - Added @CheckProcedureCacheFilter to focus plan cache analysis on
   CPU, Reads, Duration, or ExecCount. If null, we analyze all of them.
 - Added @OutputProcedureCache to include the queries we analyzed. Results are
   sorted using the @CheckProcedureCacheFilter parameter, otherwise by CPU.
 - Fixed case sensitive calls of sp_MSforeachdb reported by several users.

Changes in v11:
 - Added check for optimize for ad hoc workloads in sys.configurations.
 - Added @OutputType parameter. Choices:
  - 'TABLE' - default of one result set table with all warnings.
  - 'COUNT' - Sesame Street's favorite character will tell you how many
        problems sp_Blitz found.  Useful if you want to use a
        monitoring tool to alert you when something changed.

Changes in v10:
 - Jeremiah Peschka added check 59 for file growths set to a percentage.
 - Ned Otter added check 62 for old compatibility levels.
 - Wayne Sheffield improved checks 38 & 39 by excluding more system tables.
 - Christopher Fradenburg improved check 30 (missing alerts) by making sure
   that alerts are set up for all of the severity levels involved, not just
   some of them.
 - James Siebengartner and others improved check 14 (page verification) by
   excluding TempDB, which can't be set to checksum in older versions.
 - Added check 60 for index fill factors <> 0, 100.
 - Added check 61 for unusual SQL Server editions (not Standard, Enterprise, or
   Developer)
 - Added limitations note to point out that compatibility mode 80 won't work.
 - Fixed a bug where changes in sp_configure weren't always reported.

Changes in v9:
 - Alex Pixley fixed a spelling typo.
 - Steinar Anderson http://www.sqlservice.se fixed a date bug in checkid 2.
   That bug was reported by several users, but Steinar coded the fix.
 - Stephen Schissler added a filter for checkid 2 (missing log backups) to look
   only for databases where source_database_id is null because these are
   database snapshots, and you can't run transaction log backups on snapshots.
 - Mark Fleming @markflemingnl added checkid 62 looking for disabled alerts.
 - Checkid 17 typo changed from "disabled" to "enabled" - the check
   functionality was right, but it was warning that auto update stats async
   was "disabled".  Disabled is actually the default, but the check was
   firing because it had been enabled.  (This one was reported by many.)

Changes in v8 May 10 2012:
 - Switched more-details URLs to be short.  This way they'll render better
   when viewed in our SQL Server Management Studio reports.
 - Removed ?VersionNumber querystring parameter to shorten links in SSMS.
 - Eliminated duplicate check for startup stored procedures.

Changes in v7 April 30 2012:
 - Thomas Rushton http://thelonedba.wordpress.com/ @ThomasRushton added check
   58 for database collations that don't match the server collation.
 - Rob Pellicaan caught a bug in check 13: it was only checking for plan guides
   in the master database rather than all user databases.
 - Michal Tinthofer http://www.woodler.eu improved check 2 to work across
   collations and fix a bug in the backup_finish_date check.  (Several people
   reported this, but Michal contributed the most improvements to this check.)
 - Chris Fradenburg improved checks 38 and 39 by excluding heaps if they are
   marked is_ms_shipped, thereby excluding more system stuff.
 - Jack Whittaker fixed a bug in checkid 1.  When checking for databases
   without a full backup, we were ignoring the model database, but some shops
   really do need to back up model because they put stuff in there to be
   copied into each new database, so let's alert on that too.  Larry Silverman
   also noticed this bug.
 - Michael Burgess caught a bug in the untrusted key/constraint checks that
   were not checking for is_disabled = 0.
 - Alex Friedman fixed a bug in check 44 which required a running trace.
 - New check for SQL Agent alerts configured without operator notifications.
 - Even if @CheckUserDatabaseObjects was set to 0, some user database object
   checks were being done.
 - Check 48 for untrusted foreign keys now just returns one line per database
   that has the issue rather than listing every foreign key individually. For
   the full list of untrusted keys, run the query in the finding's URL.

Changes in v6 Dec 26 2011:
 - Jonathan Allen @FatherJack suggested tweaking sp_BlitzUpdate's error message
    about Ad Hoc Queries not being enabled so that it also includes
    instructions on how to disable them again after temporarily enabling
    it to update sp_Blitz. 

Changes in v5 Dec 18 2011:
 - John Miner suggested tweaking checkid 48 and 56, the untrusted constraints
    and keys, to look for is_not_for_replication = 0 too.  This filters out
    constraints/keys that are only used for replication and don't need to
    be trusted.
 - Ned Otter caught a bug in the URL for check 7, startup stored procs.
 - Scott (Anon) recommended using SUSER_SNAME(0x01) instead of 'sa' when
    checking for job ownership, database ownership, etc.
 - Martin Schmidt http://www.geniiius.com/blog/ caught a bug in checkid 1 and
    contributed code to catch databases that had never been backed up.
 - Added parameter for @CheckProcedureCache.  When set to 0, we skip the checks
    that are typically the slowest on servers with lots of memory.  I'm
    defaulting this to 0 so more users can get results back faster.

Changes in v4 Nov 1 2011:
 - Andreas Schubert caught a typo in the explanations for checks 15-17.
 - K. Brian Kelley @kbriankelley added checkid 57 for SQL Agent jobs set to
      start automatically on startup.
 - Added parameter for @CheckUserDatabaseObjects.  When set to 0, we skip the
    checks that are typically the slowest on large servers, the user
    database schema checks for things like triggers, hypothetical
    indexes, untrusted constraints, etc.

Changes in v3 Oct 16 2011:
 - David Tolbert caught a bug in checkid 2.  If some backups had failed or
        been aborted, we raised a false alarm about no transaction log backups.
 - Fixed more bugs in checking for SQL Server 2005. (I need more 2005 VMs!)

Changes in v2 Oct 14 2011:
 - Ali Razeghi http://www.alirazeghi.com added checkid 55 looking for
   databases owned by <> SA.
 - Fixed bugs in checking for SQL Server 2005 (leading % signs)
