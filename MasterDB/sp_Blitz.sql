To learn more, visit http://www.BrentOzar.com/go/blitz where you can download
new versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
the findings, and more.

Known limitations of this version:
 - No support for offline databases. If you can't query some of your databases,
   this script will fail.  That's fairly high on our list of things to improve
   since we like mirroring too.
 - SQL Server 2000 not quite supported (yet, but we're coding it in).

Unknown limitations of this version:
 - None.  (If we knew them, they'd be known.  Duh.)

Changes in v5 Dec 18 2011:
 - John Miner suggested tweaking checkid 48 and 56, the untrusted constraints
		and keys, to look for is_not_for_replication = 0 too.  This filters out
		constraints/keys that are only used for replication and don't need to
		be trusted.
 - Ned Otter caught a bug in the URL for check 7, startup stored procs.
 - Scott (Anon) recommended using SUSER_SNAME(0x01) instead of 'sa' when
		checking for job ownership, database ownership, etc.
 - Martin Schmidt http://www.geniiius.com/blog/ caught a bug in checkid 1 and
		contributed code to catch databases that had never been backed up.
 - Added parameter for @CheckProcedureCache.  When set to 0, we skip the checks
		that are typically the slowest on servers with lots of memory.  I'm
		defaulting this to 0 so more users can get results back faster.

Changes in v4 Nov 1 2011:
 - Andreas Schubert caught a typo in the explanations for checks 15-17.
 - K. Brian Kelley @kbriankelley added checkid 57 for SQL Agent jobs set to
   		start automatically on startup.
 - Added parameter for @CheckUserDatabaseObjects.  When set to 0, we skip the
		checks that are typically the slowest on large servers, the user
		database schema checks for things like triggers, hypothetical
		indexes, untrusted constraints, etc.

Changes in v3 Oct 16 2011:
 - David Tolbert caught a bug in checkid 2.  If some backups had failed or
        been aborted, we raised a false alarm about no transaction log backups.
 - Fixed more bugs in checking for SQL Server 2005. (I need more 2005 VMs!)

Changes in v2 Oct 14 2011:
 - Ali Razeghi http://www.alirazeghi.com added checkid 55 looking for
   databases owned by <> SA.
 - Fixed bugs in checking for SQL Server 2005 (leading % signs)


Explanation of priority levels:
  1 - Critical risk of data loss.  Fix this ASAP.
 10 - Security risk.
 20 - Security risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
 50 - Reliability risk.
 60 - Reliability risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
100 - Performance risk.
110 - Performance risk due to unusual configuration, but requires more research.
200 - Informational.
