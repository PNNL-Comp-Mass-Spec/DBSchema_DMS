This is a collection of DDL files that define the database schema used by
the Data Management System (DMS) component of the Proteomics Research 
Information Storage and Management system (PRISM) at the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory (PNNL).  PRISM incorporates a diverse set of analysis 
tools and allows a wide range of operations to be incorporated, leveraging 
a state machine that is accessible to independent, distributed computational 
nodes. The system has scaled well as data volume has increased since 2002, 
while allowing adaptability for incorporating new and improved data analysis 
tools for more effective proteomics research.

For more information see the manuscript "PRISM: a data management system 
for high-throughput proteomics" published in the journal Proteomics in 2006:
